# CPPNs in JAX

CPPNs, introduced by Kenneth Stanley and used in open-ended learning projects like PicBreeder, Enhanced POET and HyperNEAT are sparse neural networks amenable to evolutionary methods.

This library implements a CPPN for educational reasons, making use of JAX to speed computation. I hope to extend it to implementations of CPPN-related algorithms such as NEAT and HyperNEAT.
